The Developers Guide To Learning Effectively

1) You don't learn like you think you do
2) What we call "learning" is a bunch of...
3) Brain overloading is actually good for you.

Experience vs. Education
-Are we learning theory, knowledge, or skill?

Resouce (book): Theory of Action - A set of assumptions we have and actions we can perform in order to achieve a goal.

Governing Variables: The constraints we operate under when using our theory of action.

2 Changes in theory of action: 
- Slight improvements as we learn
- Huge changes brought on by delimmas we face due to our theories

Delimma 1: Actions don't meet the theories that we believe
Delimma 2: Contraining variables can no longer be satisfied
Delimma 3: When our actions change the world around us, but they change the world around so much that our theory no long works

SINGLE LOOP LEARNING
Theory of Action -> Actions we choose -> Observe & Adjust Theory

DOUBLE LOOP LEARNING
Theory of Action -> Actions we choose -> Observe & Adjust Action and Theory

*Action is a theory of believe, allow you self to change belief on reality.

1. Think about what you are doing! 
	-Be able to describe theory (why do you do the things you do?)
	-Try things to disprove your assumptions
	-TDD style when building theory

Skill - A measure of your ability to behave effectively in situations of action.

Types of Knowledges:

Explicit Knowledge - can be articulated,
Implicite Knowledge - not explicit but could be articulated and codified with effort,
Tacit Knowledge - cannot be articulated

2. Keep learning loops short!
	-Cause & Effect (the further apart they are, the hard it is to learn)
	-Keep test run shorts
	-Codewars
	-Limit work in progress

Explicit Memory - Memeory you know you know (Semantic & Episodic)

3. Keep an open mind and explore!
	-Continue to be curious 
	-You learn faster when you are suprised (so set up experiments)
	-Allow yourself to go on explorative tangets
	-Budget time for these curiosities

Implicit Memory - Things you don't necessarily have readily available as memory.

4. Seek guided learning to exploit zone of proximal development
	-Find a mentor
	-Listen to other people
	-Watching peer reviews or have group peer reviews
	-Be mindful and listen to implicit memory

Myelination - Basically muscle memory.
Neuroplasticity & Neurogenesis - DRYing things up, the more time you spend doing things, your brain wires itself to better do those things.
